# Student Project Supervision Management System
University of Glasgow Masters Project 2015

## INSTALLATION GUIDE:

1. Create a new database
2. Modify config_sample.json and change the name to config.json
3. Run install.sql in your database
4. Change RewriteBase in .htaccess file according to your website, for example: /domains/spsms
   - In addition, if your server doesn't support -MultiViews, comment this option out, otherwise it won't work
5. You're good to go


### Notes:
1. There are two default users: emil and rose, password for both is: heslo
   - emil is a student and rose is a supervisor
2. Google login won't work unless you create your own google credentials and set up the correct redirect uri (guide for setting up the credentials can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxa581kKBNg)


### Minimal requirements:
1. MySQL version 5.6.12 (might work in older versions, however not tested)
2. PHP version 5.4.37 (again, might work in older versions, however not tested)


### Folders and files that are not my work:
1. CKEditor/ â€“ replaces textarea for editing notes
2. google-api-php-client/ - google calendar + signin
3. docs/ - generated using tutorial found on phpdoc.org
4. .gitignore - ignoring files on github

Other files might contain code that is not mine, however just parts of it and it is commented inside those files what is not my work.
